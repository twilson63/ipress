# tpress

A blog post system that uses markdown and generates a simple html blog post.

You can create your markdown styles for each markdown document and publish them.

## Why

I wanted to create a cli that allows me to quickly publish an blog article either to `dat` or `now`.

I while back there was a blogger who shared an idea of creating a different color scheme per article, and I really liked that, so this is my attempt to make that easy.

## Usage

```
npm install tpress -g
echo '# Hello World' > example.md
tpress example.md > example.html
```
